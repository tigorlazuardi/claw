# Claw

A cross-platform image downloader and collection manager designed to fetch images from various sources (Reddit, Booru sites, etc.) and organize them for easy syncing to multiple devices.

## Overview

Claw is a client-server application that automatically downloads and manages images from various online sources. It's designed to collect wallpapers and images based on user-defined criteria and organize them in a way that facilitates easy syncing to different devices using tools like Syncthing.

## Features

- **Multi-source Support**: Download images from Reddit, Booru sites, and other configurable sources
- **Device-aware Collection**: Filter and organize images based on device constraints (resolution, aspect ratio, file size)
- **Scheduled Downloads**: Automatic image collection using cron-based scheduling
- **Cross-platform Clients**: Web interface, mobile apps, and CLI daemon
- **Smart Deduplication**: Avoid re-downloading existing images
- **Sync-friendly Storage**: Uses hard links when possible to optimize storage

## Architecture

### Server (Single Binary)
- **Language**: Go 1.24.4
- **Database**: SQLite (pure Go implementation)
- **Migrations**: Goose
- **Query Builder**: go-jet/jet
- **Communication**: ConnectRPC
- **Constraints**: Pure Go libraries only (no CGO)

### Clients
- **Web UI**: Svelte (image viewing, device/source management)
- **Mobile**: CapacitorJS (wallpaper selection and scheduling)
- **CLI**: Daemon mode (event hooks, wallpaper management)

## Core Concepts

### Source
Defines how to obtain images from a specific platform or service:
- Configurable parameters (subreddits, usernames, etc.)
- Countback parameter to limit search depth
- Handles authentication and rate limiting

### Device
Defines constraints for image selection:
- Resolution requirements (min/max width/height)
- Aspect ratio tolerance
- File size limits
- NSFW content handling

### Image
Represents a downloaded image with metadata:
- Dimensions and file size
- Source information
- Device assignments
- User tags and favorites

### Worker
Manages scheduled image downloads:
- Cron-based scheduling
- Executes source parameters
- Handles download failures and retries

## Development
